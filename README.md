# deeplearningforCar-Following
for a Car-Following model

the first step is to test the effect of different input length,such as 10to1.py

the second step is to test the effect of different size of training samples, such as 10000for10to1.py

the third step is to test the effect of different network structure.


finally the txt concluded all the predicted velocity of every combination of input in the data set, and then will be processed in matlab to calculate the MSE to compare effect.
